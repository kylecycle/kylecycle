- 👋 Hi, I’m @kylecycle
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use technology to do cool things.  I've done a number of home automation projects, enjoy 3D design and printing, run a home server that extensively uses Docker to manage a variety of different projects including a MythTv Server, VNC server, NAS hosting my personal video and photo library, and more.  I also enjoy spending time outside hiking, biking, skiing, photographing scenery, and I'm starting to get into running.  Professionally, I've spent the last 15+ years as a digital designer doing complex FPGA code design in VHDL and Verilog, mostly in the high-speed software defined networking and communications areas.  I've also acted as a software lead for a varieity of large software development projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, TensorFlow, Stock Market Analyisis, automation of CI/CD using Docker, and much more. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on methods of predicting stock market movement on a short-term to mid-term basis.
